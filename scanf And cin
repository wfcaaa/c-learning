question: char a[10] = ""; scanf("%s",a); printf("%s",a); when input "hello world",whether the program wrong? if no,
what is the output of the program?

the output is "hello". because the scanf function will ignore the part which after "space" character,so only "hello" will be stored
into arr a,the lenth of "hello" is five,which is less than the lenth of arr a. 

the same to "cin", cin also ignore the part which after "space"
